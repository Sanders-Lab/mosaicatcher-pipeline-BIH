To run mosaicatcher in manual segment mode:
	- add a bed file of manual segments to the pipeline folder (see examples):
		.../pipeline/manual_segmentation/samplename.bed

	- Run the pipeline
	
	- Provide probabilities.R as an input to regenotype.R
		(+ if you want to stratify by something, you can also provide a file like naming_HG733.bed)

Attention: the bed file of manual segments can currently only deal with non-overlapping segments. If there is anything overlapping, 
the pipeline will crash (this should be fixed soon.)
