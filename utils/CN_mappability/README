Before running the Snakefile:
Download bigBedToBed from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64.v369/bigBedToBed and give its path in config.json.

You MAY need to do the following to make it executable:
chmod +x ./filePath/bigBedToBed 


All the Copy Number bigbed files should be in bigBeds/ with a name format {sample}_wssd.bb

The file with inversion intervals should be in input_invs/ and named {sample}.bed (one file per sample)..
If multiple inversion callsets are at hand, merge and sort them to make one {sample}.bed

The mapping track path should also be given in config.json. 
Todo: Put the finalised mapping track somewhere that is publically accessible.
Note that it takes mapping track with 5 columns (space seperated) chr,start,end,correctly mapped reads, incorrectly mapped reads



This pipeline generates average copy number and mapabilty for each arbitrary segment (in the input_invs/{sample}.bed). 
The output files (result/{sample}_CN.txt) are required to run the regenotyer
